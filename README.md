# Turn2us take-home challenge

## How to use:

- Visit the deployed site on [GitHub Pages here](https://joe-dev-public.github.io/fac-turn2us-take-home-challenge/)
- Enter a date of birth
- Submit the form
- The outcome message is displayed
- Try a DOB with all zeroes for the day, month or year to see a demo of a validation message

## Possible next steps?

- Format the input as it's typed, e.g. like Turn2us do: ```__/__/____```
- Better validation of input as it's typed (and after)
  - Make sure that the date is the accepted format (day 01-31, month 01-12), and a valid date (actually in the calendar, so not 31st Feb for example).
- Better user feedback if the date isn't entered correctly
- Add automated tests so the age-checking functions can be tested quickly and easily!
